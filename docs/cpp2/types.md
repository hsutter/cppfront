# Types

## Overview

A user-defined `type` is written using the same **name `:` kind `=` value** [declaration syntax](../cpp2/declarations.md) as everything in Cpp2. The type's "value" is a `{}`-enclosed body containing more declarations.

In a `type`, data members are private by default, and functions and nested types are public by default. To explicitly declare a type scope declaration `public`, `protected`, or `private`, write that keyword at the beginning of the declaration.

``` cpp title="Example: Writing a simple type"
mytype: type =
{
    // data members are private by default
    x: std::string;

    // functions are public by default
    protected f: (this) = { do_something_with(x); }

    // ...
}
```

## `this` — The parameter name

**`this`** is a synonym for the current object. Inside the scope of a type that has a member named `member`, `member` by default means `this.member`.

> Note: In Cpp2, `this` is not a pointer.

The name `this` may only be used for the first parameter of a type-scope function (aka member function). It is never declared with an explicit `: its_type` because its type is always the current type.

`this` can be an `in` (default), `inout`, `out`, or `move` parameter. Which you choose naturally determines what kind of member function is being declared:

- **`in this`**: Writing `myfunc: (this /*...*/)`, which is shorthand for `myfunc: (in this /*...*/)`, defines a Cpp1 `const`-qualified member function, because  `in` parameters are `const`.

- **`inout this`**: Writing `myfunc: (inout this /*...*/)` defines a Cpp1 non-`const` member function.

- **`out this`**: Writing `myfunc: (out this /*...*/)` defines a Cpp1 constructor... and more. (See below.)

- **`move this`**: Writing `myfunc: (move this /*...*/)` defines a Cpp1 `&&`-qualified member function, or if there are no additional parameters it defines the destructor.

For example, here is how to write read-only member function named `print` that takes a read-only string value and prints this object's data value and the string message:

``` cpp title="Example: this"
mytype: type = {
    data: i32;   // some data member (private by default)

    print: (this, msg: std::string) = {
        std::cout << data << msg;
                 // "data" is shorthand for "this.data"
    }

    // ...
}
```

## `this` — Inheritance

Base types are written as members named this. For example, just as a type could write a data member as `data: string = "xyzzy";`, which is pronounced "`data` is a `string` defined as having the default value `"xyzzy"`, a base type is written as `this: Shape = (default, values);`, which is pronounced "`this` is a `Shape` defined as having these default values."

> Cpp2 syntax has no separate base list or separate member initializer list.

Because base and member subobjects are all declared in the same place (the type body) and initialized in the same place (an `operator=` function body), they can be written in any order, including interleaved, and are still guaranteed to be safely initialized in declared order. This means that in Cpp2 you can declare a data member object before a base subobject, so that it naturally outlives the base subobject.

> Cpp2 code doesn't need workarounds like Boost's `base_from_member`, because all of the motivating examples for that can be written directly. See [this explanation](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/issues/334#issuecomment-1500984173) for details.

## `virtual`, `override`, and `final` — Virtual functions

A `this` parameter can additionally be declared as one of the following:

- **`virtual`**: Writing `myfunc: (virtual this /*...*/)` defines a new virtual function.

- **`override`**: Writing `myfunc: (override this /*...*/)` defines an override of an existing base class virtual function.

- **`final`**: Writing `myfunc: (final this /*...*/)` defines a final override of an existing base class virtual function.

A pure virtual function is a function with a `virtual this` parameter and no body.

For example:

``` cpp title="Example: Virtual functions"
abstract_base: type
= {
    //  A pure virtual function: virtual + no body
    print: (virtual this, msg: std::string);

    // ...
}

derived: type
= {
    //  'this' is-an 'abstract_base'
    this: abstract_base;

    //  Explicit override
    print: (override this, msg: std::string);

    // ...
}
```


## `implicit` — Controlling conversion functions

A `this` parameter of an `operator=` function can additionally be declared as:

- **`implicit`**: Writing `operator=: (implicit out this, /*...*/)` defines a function that will not be marked as "explicit" when lowered to Cpp1 syntax.

> Note: This reverses the Cpp1 default, where constructors are not "explicit" by default, and you have to write "explicit" to make them explicit.


## `operator=` — Construction, assignment, and destruction

All value operations are spelled `operator=`, including construction, assignment, and destruction. `operator=` sets the value of `this` object, so the `this` parameter can be passed as anything but `in` (which would imply `const`):

- **`out this`:** Writing `operator=: (out this /*...*/ )` is naturally both a constructor and an assignment operator, because an `out` parameter can take an uninitialized or initialized argument. If you don't write a more-specialized `inout this` assignment operator, Cpp2 will use the `out this` function also for assignment.

- **`inout this`:** Writing `operator=: (inout this /*...*/ )` is an assignment operator (only), because an `inout` parameter requires an initialized modifiable argument.

- **`move this`:** Writing `operator=: (move this)` is the destructor. No other parameters are allowed, so it connotes "move `this` nowhere."

Unifying `operator=` enables usable `out` parameters, which is essential for composable guaranteed initialization. We want the expression syntax `x = value` to be able to call a constructor or an assignment operator, so naming them both `operator=` is consistent.

TODO Return type of assignment operator?

> Note: Writing `=` always invokes an `operator=` (in fact for a Cpp2-authored type, and semantically for a Cpp1-authored type). This avoids the Cpp1 inconsistency that "writing `=` calls `operator=`, except when it doesn't" (such as in a Cpp1 variable initialization). Conversely, `operator=` is always invoked by `=` in Cpp2.

### `that` — A source parameter

All type-scope functions can have **`that`** as its second parameter, which is a synonym for the object to be copied/moved from. Like `this`, at type scope it is never declared with an explicit `: its_type` because its type is always the current type.

`that` can be an `in` (default) or `move` parameter. Which you choose naturally determines what kind of member function is being declared:

- **`in that`**: Writing `myfunc: (/*...*/ this, that)`, which is shorthand for `myfunc: (/*...*/ this, in that)`, is naturally both a copy and move function, because it can accept an lvalue or an rvalue `that` argument. If you don't write a more-specialized `move that` move function, Cpp2 will automatically use the `in that` function also for move.

- **`move that`**: Writing `myfunc: (/*...*/ this, move that)` defines a move function.

Putting `this` and `that` together: The most general form of `operator=` is `operator=: (out this, that)`. It works as a unified general {copy, move} x { constructor, assignment } operator, and generates all of four of those in the lowered Cpp1 code if you didn't write a more specific one yourself.


### `operator=` can generalize (A)ssignment from construction, and (M)ove from copy

As mentioned above:
- If you don't write an `inout this` function, Cpp2 will use your `out this` function in its place (if you wrote one).
- If you don't write a `move that` function, Cpp2 will use your `in that` function in its place (if you wrote one).

> Note: When lowering to Cpp1, this just means generating the applicable special member functions from the appropriate Cpp2 function.

This graphic summarizes these generalizations. For convenience I've numbered the (A)ssignment and (M)ove defaults.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1801526/226261443-03125a35-7890-4cc7-bf7d-f23b3a0bb0df.png)

In Cpp1 terms, they can be described as follows:

- **(M)ove, M1, M2:** If you write a copy constructor or assignment operator, but not a corresponding move constructor or assignment operator, the latter is generated.

- **(A)ssignment, A1, A2, A3:** If you write a copy or move or converting constructor, but not a corresponding copy or move or converting assignment operator, the latter is generated.

- **The arrows are transitive.** For example, if you write a copy constructor and nothing else, the move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator are generated.

- **M2 is preferred over A2.** Both M2 and A2 can generate a missing `(inout this, move that)` function. If both options are available, Cpp2 prefers to use M2 (generate move assignment from copy assignment, which could itself have been generated from copy construction) rather than A2 (generate move assignment from move construction). This is because M2 is a better fit: Move assignment is more like copy assignment than like move construction, because assignments are designed structurally to set the value of an existing `this` object.

The most general `operator=` with `that` is `(out this, that)`. In Cpp1 terms, it generates all four combinations of { copy, move } x { constructor, assignment }. This is often sufficient, so you can write all these value-setting functions just once. If you do want to write a more specific version that does something else, though, you can always write it too.

> Note: Generating `inout this` (assignment) from `out this` also generates **converting assignment** from converting construction, which is a new thing. Today in Cpp1, if you write a converting constructor from another type `X`, you may or may not write the corresponding assignment from `X`; in Cpp2 you will get that by default, and it sets the object to the same state as the converting constructor from `X` does.



### Minimal functions generated by default

There are only two defaults the language will generate implicitly for a type:

- The only special function every type must have is the destructor. If you don't write it by hand, a public nonvirtual destructor is generated by default.

- If no `operator=` functions other than the destructor are written by hand, a public default constructor is generated by default.

All other `operator=` functions are explicitly written, either by hand or by opting into applying a metafunction (see below).

> Note: Because generated functions are always opt-in, you can never get a generated function that's wrong for your type, and so Cpp2 doesn’t need to support "=delete" for the purpose of suppressing unwanted generated functions.

### Memberwise by default

All copy/move/comparison `operator=` functions are memberwise by default in Cpp2. That includes when you write memberwise construction and assignment yourself.

In a hand-written `operator=`:

- The body must begin with a series of `member = value;` statements, one for each of the type's data members (including base classes) in declaration order.

- If the body does not mention a member in the appropriate place in the beginning section, by default the member's default initializer is used.

- In an assignment operator (`inout this`), you can explicitly skip setting a member by writing `member = _;` where it would normally be set if you know you have a reason to set its value later instead or if the existing value needs to be preserved.

For example:

``` cpp title="Memberwise operator= semantics
mytype: type
= {
    //  data members (private by default)
    name:          std::string;
    social_handle: std::string = "(unknown)";

    //  conversion from string
    operator=: (out this, who: std::string) = {
        name = who;
        //  if social_handle is not mentioned, defaults to:
        //      social_handle = "(unknown)";

        //  now that the members have been set,
        //  any other code can follow...
        print();
    }

    //  copy/move constructor/assignment
    operator=: (out this, that) = {
        //  if neither data member is mentioned, defaults to:
        //      name = that.name;
        //      social_handle = that.social_handle;
        print();
    }

    // TODO skipping the default memberwise assignment for later setting

    print: (this) = std::cout << "value is [(name)$] [(social_handle)$]\n";
}

//  The above definition of mytype allows all of the following...
main: () = {
    x: mytype = "Jim"; // construct from string
    x = "John";        // assign from string
    y := x;            // copy construct
    y = x;             // copy assign
    z := (move x);     // move construct
    z = (move y);      // move assign
    x.print();         // "value is [] []" - moved from
    y.print();         // "value is [] []" - moved from
}
```

> Note: This makes memberwise semantics symmetric for construction and assignment. In Cpp1, only non-copy/move constructors have a default, which is to initialize a member with its default initializer. In Cpp2, both constructors and assignment operators default to using the default initializer if it's a conversion function (non-`that`, aka non-copy/move), and using memberwise `member = that.member;` for copy/move functions.




## `operator<=>` — Unified comparisons

Most of Cpp2's `operator<=>` has already been merged into ISO C++, except for allowing chained comparisons. In Cpp2, comparisons can be safely chained, and always have the mathematically sound transitive meaning or else are rejected at compile time:

- **Valid chains: All `<`/`<=`, all `>`/`>=`, or all `==`.** All mathematically sound and safe chains like `a <= b < c` are supported, with efficient single evaluation of each term. They are "sound" because they are transitive; these chains imply a relationship between `a` and `c` (in this case, the chain implies that `a <= c` is also true).

- **Invalid chains: Everything else.** Nonsense chains like `a >= b < c` and `a != b != c` are compile time errors. They are "nonsense" because they are non-transitive; these chains do not imply any relationship between `a` and `c`.
