## <a id="ufcs"></a> Calling functions: `f(x)` syntax, and `x.f()` UFCS syntax

A function argument list is a [list](common.md#lists) of arguments enclosed by `(` `)` parentheses.

A function call like `f(x)` is a normal function call that will call non-member functions only, as usual in C++.

A function call like `x.f()` is a unified function call syntax (aka UFCS) call. It will call a member function if one is available, and otherwise will call `f(x)`. Having UFCS is important for generic code that may want to call a member or a non-member function, whichever is available. It's also important to enable fluid programming styles and natural IDE autocompletion support.

An operator notation call like `#!cpp a + b` will call an overloaded operator function if one is available, as usual in C++.

For example:

``` cpp title="Function calls" hl_lines="3 7 11 16 19 20"
//  Generic function to log something
//  This calls operator<< using operator notation
log: (x) = clog << x;

f: ( v : std::vector<widget> ) = {
    //  This calls log() with the result of std::vector::size()
    log( v.size() );

    //  This calls log() with the result of std::ssize(v), because
    //  v doesn't have a .ssize member function
    log( v.ssize() );
}

//  Generic function to print "hello, ___!" for any printable type
hello: (name) = {
    myfile := fopen("xyzzy.txt", "w");
    //  Direct calls to C nonmember functions, using UFCS and safe
    //  string interpolation (instead of type-unsafe format strings)
    myfile.fprintf( "Hello, (name)$!\n" );
    myfile.fclose();
    //  The C and C++ standard libraries are not only fully available,
    //  but safer (and arguably nicer) when used from Cpp2 syntax code
}
```

To explicitly treat an object name passed as an argument as `move` or `out`, write that keyword before the variable name.

- Explicit `move` is rarely needed. Every definite last use of a local variable will apply `move` by default. Writing `move` from an object before its definite last use means that later uses may see a moved-from state.

- Explicit `out` is needed only when initializing a local variable separately from its declaration using a call to a function with an `out` parameter. For details, see [Guaranteed initialization](../cpp2/objects.md#init).

For example:



## <a id="wildcard"></a> <a id="discard"></a> `_` — the "don't care" wildcard, including explicit discard

`_` is pronounced **"don't care"** and allowed as a wildcard in most contexts. For example:

``` cpp title="Using the _ wildcard" hl_lines="2 5 11"
//  We don't care about the guard variable's name
_ : std::lock_guard = mut;

//  If we don't care to write the variable's type, deduce it
x : _ = 42;
    // in cases like this, _ can be omitted...
    // this is equivalent to "x := 42;"

return inspect v -> std::string {
    is std::vector = "v is a std::vector";
    is _ = "unknown";   // don't care what else, match anything
};
```

Cpp2 treats all function outputs (return values, and results produced via `inout` and `out` parameters) as important, and does not let them be silently discarded by default. To explicitly discard such a value, assign it to `_`. For example:

``` cpp title="Using _ for explicit discard" hl_lines="1 8"
_ = vec.emplace_back(1,2,3);
    // "_ =" is required to explicitly discard emplace_back's
    // return value (which is non-void since C++17)

{
    x := my_vector.begin();
    std::advance(x, 2);
    _ = x;  // required to explicitly discard x's new value,
            // because std::advance modifies x's value
}
```

For details, see [Design note: Explicit discard](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/wiki/Design-note%3A-Explicit-discard). In Cpp2, data is always initialized, data is never silently lost, data flow is always visible. Data is precious, and it's always safe.


## <a id="is"></a> `is` — safe type/value queries

An `x is C` expression allows safe type and value queries, and evaluates to `#!cpp true` if `x` matches constraint `C`. It supports both static and dynamic queries, including customization, with support for standard library dynamic types like `std::variant`, `std::optional`, `std::expected`, and `std::any` provided out of the box.

There are two kinds of `is`:

- A **type query**, where `C` is a type constraint: a type, a template name, a concept, or a type predicate. Here `x` may be a type, or an object or expression; if it is an object or expression, the query refers to `x`'s type.

| Type constraint kind | Example |
|---|---|
| Static type query | `x is int` |
| Dynamic type query | `ptr* is Shape` |
| Static template type query | `x is std::vector` |
| Static concept query | `x is std::integral` |

- A **value query**, where `C` is a value constraint: a value, or a value predicate. Here `x` must be an object or expression.

| Value constraint kind | Example |
|---|---|
| Value | `#!cpp x is 0` |
| Value predicate | `#!cpp x is (in(10, 20))` |

`is` is useful throughout the language, including in `inspect` pattern matching alternatives. `is` is extensible, and works out of the box with `std::variant`, `std::optional`, `std::expected`, and `std::any`. For examples, see:

- [`pure2-type-safety-2-with-inspect-expression.cpp2`](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/tree/main/regression-tests/pure2-type-safety-2-with-inspect-expression.cpp2)

Here are some `is` queries with their Cpp1 equivalents. In this table, uppercase names are type names, lowercase names are objects, `v` is a `std::variant` where one alternative is `T`, `o` is a `std::optional<T>`, and `a` is a `std::any`:

| Some sample `is` queries | Cpp1 equivalent
|---|---|
| `X is Y && Y is X` | `std::is_same_v<X,Y>` |
| `D is B` | `std::is_base_of<B,D>` |
| `#!cpp pb is *D` | `#!cpp dynamic_cast<D*>(pb) != nullptr` |
| `v is T`  | `std::holds_alternative<T>(v)` |
| `a is T`  | `#!cpp a.type() == typeid(T)` |
| `o is T`  | `o.has_value()` |

> Note: `is` unifies a variety of differently-named Cpp1 language and library queries under one syntax, and supports only the type-safe ones.


## <a id="as"></a> `as` — safe casts and conversions

An `x as T` expression allows safe type casts. `x` must be an object or expression, and `T` must be a type. Like `is`, `as` supports both static and dynamic typing, including customization, with support for standard library dynamic types like `std::variant`, `std::optional`, `std::expected`, and `std::any` provided out of the box. For example:

``` cpp title="Using as" hl_lines="4 6 14"
main: () = {
    a: std::any = 0;                // a's type is now int, value 0
    test(a);                        // prints "zero"
    a = "plugh" as std::string;     // a's type is now std::string, value "plugh"
    test(a);                        // prints "plugh"
    test("xyzzy" as std::string);   // prints "xyzzy"
}

//  A generic function that takes an argument 'x' of any type,
//  same as "void test( auto const& x )" in C++20 syntax
test: (x) = {
    std::cout << inspect x -> std::string {
        is 0           = "zero";
        is std::string = x as std::string;
        is _           = "(no match)";
    } << "\n";
}
```

Here are some `as` casts with their Cpp1 equivalents. In this table, uppercase names are type names, lowercase names are objects, `v` is a `std::variant` where one alternative is `T`, `o` is a `std::optional<T>`, and `a` is a `std::any`:

| Some sample `as` casts | Cpp1 equivalent
|---|---|
| `x as Y` | `Y{x}` |
| `#!cpp pb as *D` | `#!cpp dynamic_cast<D*>(pb)` |
| `v as T`  | `std::get<T>(v)` |
| `a as T`  | `std::any_cast<T>(a)` |
| `o as T`  | `o.value()` |

> Note: `as` unifies a variety of differently-named Cpp1 language and library casts and conversions under one syntax, and supports only the type-safe ones.


## <a id="inspect"></a> `inspect` — pattern matching

An `inspect expr -> Type = { /* alternatives */ }` expression allows pattern matching using `is`.

- `expr` is evaluated once.

- Each alternative is spelled `is C = statement;` and are evaluated in order. Each `is C` is evaluated as if called with `expr is C`, and if it evaluates to `#!cpp true`, then its `#!cpp = alternative;` body is used as the value of the entire `inspect` expression, and the meaning is the same as if the entire `inspect` expression had been written as just `#!cpp :Type = alternative;` — i.e., an unnamed object expression (aka 'temporary object') of type `Type` initialized with `alternative`.

- A catchall `is _` is required.

For example:

``` cpp title="Using inspect" hl_lines="6-13"
//  A generic function that takes an argument 'x' of any type
//  and inspects various things about `x`
test: (x) = {
    forty_two := 42;
    std::cout
        << inspect x -> std::string {
            is 0           = "zero";            // == 0
            is (forty_two) = "the answer";      // == 42
            is int         = "integer";         // is type int (and not 0 or 42)
            is std::string = x as std::string;  // is type std::string
            is std::vector = "a std::vector";   // is a vector</*of-some-type*/>
            is _           = "(no match)";      // is something else
        }
        << "\n";
}

//  Sample call site
test(42);
    //  Behaves as if the following function were called:
    //      test: (x) = { std::cout << (:std::string = "the answer") << "\n"; }
    //  (and that's why inspect alternatives are introduced with '=')
```

For more examples, see also the examples in the previous two sections on `is` and `as`, many of which use `inspect`.


## <a id="captures"></a> `$` — captures, including interpolations

Suffix `$` is pronounced **"paste the value of"** and captures the value of an expression at the point when the expression where the capture is written is evaluated. Depending on the complexity of the capture expression `expr$` and where it is used, parentheses `(expr)$` may be required for precedence or to show the boundaries of the expression.

`x$` always captures `x` by value. To capture by reference, take the address and capture a pointer using `x&$`. If the value is immediately used, dereference again; for example `:(val) total&$* += val` adds to the `total` local variable itself, not a copy.

Captures are evaluated at the point where they are written in function expressions, contract postconditions, and string literals. The stored captured value can then be used later when evaluating its context, such as when the function expression body containing the captured value is actually called later (one or more times), when the postcondition containing the captured value is evaluated later when the function returns, or when the string literal containing the captured value is read later.

The design and syntax are selected so that capture is spelled the same way in all contexts. For details, see [Design note: Capture](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/wiki/Design-note%3A-Capture).


### <a id="function-captures"></a> Capture in function expressions (aka lambdas)

Any capture in a function expression body is evaluated at the point where the function expression is written, at the declaration of the function expression. The function expression itself is then evaluated each time the function is invoked, and can reference the captured value.

For example:

``` cpp title="Capture in an unnamed function expression (aka lambda)" hl_lines="7 8 13-18"
main: () = {
    s := "-ish\n";
    vec: std::vector = (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 );

    std::ranges::for_each(
        vec,
        :(i) = std::cout << i << s$
        //  Function capture: Paste the value of 's'
    );
}

//  prints:
//      1-ish
//      2-ish
//      3-ish
//      5-ish
//      8-ish
//      13-ish
```

Another example:

``` cpp title="Capture in a named function expression (aka lambda)" hl_lines="2 4 7 12 13"
main: () = {
    price := 100;
    func := :() = {
        std::cout << "Price = " << price$ << "\n";
    };
    func();
    price = 200;
    func();
}

//  prints:
//      Price = 100
//      Price = 100
```


### <a id="postcondition-captures"></a> Capture in contract postconditions

Any capture in a postcondition is evaluated at the point where the postcondition is written, at the beginning (entry) of the function. The postcondition itself is then evaluated when the function returns, and can reference the captured value.

For example:

``` cpp title="Capture in contract postconditions" hl_lines="2"
push_back: (coll, value)
    post(coll.ssize() == coll.ssize()$ + 1)
    //  Paste the value of `coll.ssize()`
= {
    // ...
}
```


### <a id="interpolation"></a> Capture in string interpolation

A string literal can capture the value of an expression `expr` by writing `(expr)$` inside the string literal. The `(` `)` are required, and cannot be nested. A string literal has type `std::string` if it performs any captures, otherwise it is a normal C/C++ string literal (array of characters).

Any capture in a string literal is evaluated at the point where the string literal is written. The string literal can be used repeatedly later, and includes the captured value.

For example:

``` cpp title="Capture for string interpolation" hl_lines="2 5"
x := 0;
std::cout << "x is (x)$\n";
        // Paste the value of `x`
x = 1;
std::cout << "now x+2 is (x+2)$\n";
        // Paste the value of `x+2`

//  prints:
//      x is 0
//      now x+2 is 3
```

A string literal capture can include a `:suffix` where the suffix is a [standard C++ format specification](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/spec). For example, `#!cpp (x.price(): <10.2f)$` evaluates `x.price()` and converts the result to a string with 10-character width, 2 digits of precision, and left-justified.
