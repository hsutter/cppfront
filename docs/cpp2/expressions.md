## `_` — the "don't care" wildcard, including explicit discard

`_` is pronounced **"don't care"** and allowed as a wildcard in most contexts. For example:

``` cpp title="Example: _ wildcard"
//  We don't care about the guard variable's name
_ : std::lock_guard = mut;

//  If we don't care to write the variable's type, deduce it
x : _ = 42;
    // in cases like this, _ can be omitted...
    // this is equivalent to "x := 42;"

return inspect v -> std::string {
    is std::vector = "v is a std::vector";
    is _ = "unknown";   // don't care what else, match anything
};
```

Cpp2 treats all function outputs (return values, and results produced via `inout` and `out` parameters) as important, and does not let them be silently discarded by default. To explicitly discard such a value, assign it to `_`. For example:

``` cpp title="Example: Using _ for explicit discard"
_ = vec.emplace_back(1,2,3);
    // "_ =" is required to explicitly discard emplace_back's
    // return value (which is non-void since C++17)

{
    x := my_vector.begin();
    std::advance(x, 2);
    _ = x;  // required to explicitly discard x's new value,
            // because std::advance modifies x's value
}
```

For details, see [Design note: Explicit discard](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/wiki/Design-note%3A-Explicit-discard). In Cpp2, data is always initialized, data is never silently lost, data flow is always visible. Data is precious, and it's always safe. This feels right and proper to me.


## `is` — safe type/value queries

An `x is C` expression allows safe type and value queries, and evaluates to `true` if `x` matches constraint `C`. It supports both static and dynamic queries, including customization, with support for the standard dynamically typed libraries `std::variant`, `std::optional`, and `std::any` provided in the box.

There are two kinds of `is`:

- A **type query**, where `C` is a type constraint: a type, a template name, a concept, or a type predicate. Here `x` may be a type, or an object or expression; if it is an object or expression, the query refers to `x`'s type.

| Type constraint kind | Example |
|---|---|
| Static type query | `x is int` |
| Dynamic type query | `ptr* is Shape` |
| Static template type query | `x is std::vector` |
| Static concept query | `x is std::integral` |

- A **value query**, where `C` is a value constraint: a value, or a value predicate. Here `x` must be an object or expression.

| Value constraint kind | Example |
|---|---|
| Value | `x is 0` |
| Value predicate | `x is (in(10, 20))` |

`is` is useful throughout the language, including in `inspect` pattern matching alternatives. `is` is extensible, and works out of the box with `std::variant`, `std::optional`, and `std::any`. For examples, see:

## `as` — safe casts and conversions

An `x as T` expression allows safe type casts. `x` must be an object or expression, and `T` must be a type. It supports both static and dynamic typing, including customization with support for the standard dynamically typed libraries `std::variant`, `std::optional`, and `std::any` provided in the box. For example:

``` cpp title="Example: Using as"
main: () = {
    a: std::any = 0;                // a's type is now int, value 0
    test(a);                        // prints "zero"
    a = "plugh" as std::string;     // a's type is now std::string, value "plugh"
    test(a);                        // prints "plugh"
    test("xyzzy" as std::string);   // prints "xyzzy"
}

//  A generic function that takes an argument 'x' of any type,
//  same as "void test( auto const& x )" in C++20 syntax
test: (x) = {
    std::cout << inspect x -> std::string {
        is 0           = "zero";
        is std::string = x as std::string;
        is _           = "(no match)";
    } << "\n";
}
```

## `inspect` — pattern matching

An `inspect expr -> Type` expression allows pattern matching using `is`.

- `expr` is evaluated once.
- Each alternative spelled `is C` is evaluated in order as if called with `expr is C`.
- If an alternative evaluates to `true`, then its `= alternative;` body is used as the value of the entire `inspect` expression, and the meaning is the same as if the entire `inspect` expression had been written as just `:Type = alternative;` — i.e., an unnamed object expression (aka 'temporary object') of type `Type` initialized with `alternative`.
- A catchall `is _` is required.

For example:

``` cpp title="Example: Using inspect"
//  A generic function that takes an argument 'x' of any type
//  and inspects various things about `x`
test: (x) = {
    forty_two := 42;
    std::cout << inspect x -> std::string {
        is 0           = "zero";            // == 0
        is (forty_two) = "the answer";      // == 42
        is int         = "integer";         // is type int (and not 0 or 42)
        is std::string = x as std::string;  // is type std::string
        is std::vector = "a std::vector";   // is a vector</*of-some-type*/>
        is _           = "(no match)";      // is something else
    } << "\n";
}

//  Sample call site
test(42);
    //  Behaves as if the following function were called:
    //      test: (x) = { std::cout << (:std::string = "the answer") << "\n"; }
    //  (and that's why inspect alternatives are introduced with '=')
```
