pure2-cpp1-multitoken-fundamental-types-error.cpp2(3,8): error: 'signed short int' is an old-style C/C++ multi-word keyword type
    - most such types should be used only for interoperability with older code
    - using those when you need them is fine, but name them with these short names instead:
        ushort, uint, ulong, longlong, ulonglong, __schar, __uchar
