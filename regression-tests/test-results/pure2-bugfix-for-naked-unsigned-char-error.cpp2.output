pure2-bugfix-for-naked-unsigned-char-error.cpp2(2,8): error: 'unsigned char' - did you mean 'u8' (usually best) or 'cpp2::_uchar'?
pure2-bugfix-for-naked-unsigned-char-error.cpp2(2,8): error: 'unsigned char' is an old-style C/C++ multi-word keyword type
    - most such types should be used only for interoperability with older code
    - using those when you need them is fine, but name them with these short names instead:
        short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, longlong, ulonglong, longdouble, _schar, _uchar
    - see also cpp2util.h > "Convenience names for integer types"
