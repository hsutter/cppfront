## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant  the rights to use your contribution. A sample of the CLA is below.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot or human will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided. You will only need to do this once for all your contributions to cppfront.
